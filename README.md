# Kaggle-Titanic
This repository contains different solution approaches to the introductory Kaggle project, Titanic:  Machine Learning from Disaster.

The Simple Model uses a GLM and only takes into account passenger sex and passenger class of ticket to predit survival, which it does with 76.6% accuracy.

The Small Neural Net file uses a neural network and only takes into account passenger sex and passenger class of ticket to predict survival.  I was curious if it would perform any better than a simple regression.  It does not.  It also delivers 76.6% accuracy.  This makes sense.  I expect the advantage of the neural network will kick in as the model gets more complicated....

I plan to make more complex models in the near future to improve predictions.
